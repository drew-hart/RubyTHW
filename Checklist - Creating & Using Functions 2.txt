Ruby Function Checklist:

1) Did you start the function with "def"?
2) Does your function only include characters and underscores ("_")?
3) Did you include and open your function with an open parenthesis?
4) Did you place your arguments after the open parenthesis and include commas between each one?
5) Are the arguments you used unique, meaning no duplicate names?
6) Did include a close parenthesis after the arguments?
7) Did you indent all lines of code with two spaces or a tab?
8) Did you close the function with "end"?

And when you run (aka "use" or "call") a function, check these things:

Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
Did you put ( character after the name to run it? (this isn't required, but is idiomatic)
Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
Did you end the function call with a ) character.
Use these two checklists on the remaining lessons until you do not need them anymore.
